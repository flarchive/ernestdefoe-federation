 *  - a later reply → cross-posted to the author's followers + remote
 *    participants already in the thread.

 * Delivery is queued; everything is a no-op unless federation is enabled and the
 * discussion is readable by guests and member-authored (see Federation::shouldFederate).
 * A post held for approval federates when it is approved (PostWasApproved).
